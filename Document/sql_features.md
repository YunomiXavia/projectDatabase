# SQL Features Document

## SQL Basic Features (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### Tag, Role, Task

**Manage Tag, Role, Task**
- Insert Skill and Role and Task:
+ add Skills Tag:
```sql
    INSERT INTO Skills (skill_name, skill_description)
    VALUES ('Tên kỹ năng', 'Mô tả kỹ năng');
```

- add Role Tag:
